This repository is supposed to simulate a test-driven development of an app. The app itself presents a list of coding events in various major cities. Can filter be what city or the number of events you would like to see. This app also is downloadable on to the desktop as a PWA.

How to run this app -

In the terminal - 'npm run start'
Which will run locally on "localhost:3000"

This project does pull from a Google Calendar. With that being said, I can't verify this app while deploying on github-pages. There might be a Google sign-in when the app is opened saying that the app hasn't been verified and its not deemed safe. I can't verify the app because I don't "own" my gh-page.
